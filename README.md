Last year Netflix released some simple guidelines for DIY socks that would pause your Netflix show/movie if you were detected to be sleeping. I thought this would be a great gift so I took the challenge. Due to the lack of information online, I figured I would share the solutions I have found to some problems encountered during my journey.

Note: The most difficult part of this tutorial is working with microelectronics. If you have zero experience with electronics or soldering, proceed with caution. The circuit schematic is complicated for beginners and it leaves out very important details that beginners will not account for. Additionally, this project is NOT cheap. There's a reason Netflix released this as a DIY project, it's not profitable. If you don't have spare parts laying around and need to buy everything required, this will easily run you $250. If you're okay with all this, check out my components list.
